# Entity Lifecycle System

This project implements an autonomous six-phase entity lifecycle system as described in the specifications. Entities navigate through their lifecycle phases independently, making transition decisions based on internal evaluation.

## Overview

The system implements the following six phases for each entity:

1. **Birth**: Creation with defined purpose, including a stabilization sub-phase to refine configuration and resolve purpose ambiguities.
2. **Exploration**: Initial learning and experimentation to understand the environment and refine purpose interpretation.
3. **Execution**: Performing functions while gathering data, with sub-phases for strict execution (critical tasks) and proactive testing (learning).
4. **Reflection**: Analyzing alignment with purpose and assessing environmental changes, including potential purpose evolution.
5. **Adaptation**: Self-modifying to improve performance or redefine purpose, with safety checks.
6. **Retirement**: Exiting when purpose is fulfilled, with knowledge transfer to successors and preservation for potential rebirth.

## Core Components

### Entities

Entities are the central objects in the system. Each entity:
- Has a defined purpose
- Navigates autonomously through lifecycle phases
- Makes decisions based on internal evaluation
- Interacts with the environment
- Gathers and learns from data
- Can evolve its purpose based on reflection

### Environment

The environment represents the context in which entities operate:
- Contains conditions that affect entities
- Changes over time (simulated)
- Can be organized into zones (in advanced implementations)

### Phases

Each phase is implemented as a separate class with methods to:
- Enter the phase
- Execute phase-specific logic
- Exit the phase
- Determine if transition to another phase is allowed

## Advanced Features

The system includes additional components for more complex implementations:

- **Event Bus**: Allows entities to communicate with each other
- **Resource Manager**: Handles acquisition and usage of resources
- **Advanced Environment**: Supports zones and environmental events
- **Advanced Entity**: Extends base entity with communication and resource capabilities
- **Entity Factory**: Creates specialized entity types for different purposes

## Usage Examples

The accompanying usage examples demonstrate:

1. **Basic Usage**: Simple entity lifecycle simulation
2. **Advanced Multi-Entity Scenario**: Multiple entities with communication and resource management
3. **Purpose Evolution**: Observing how an entity's purpose evolves over time

## Implementation Notes

- The system is implemented in TypeScript, focusing on clean object-oriented design
- Entities make autonomous decisions using internal state and environment conditions
- The phase transitions follow predefined rules but allow for variation based on entity state
- Each phase has progress tracking (0-1 scale) to determine completion
- Resource management and event communication provide extensibility
- History tracking allows for analysis of entity lifecycle events

## Extension Points

The system can be extended in various ways:

- Adding more complex environment simulations
- Implementing specialized entity types for specific domains
- Creating more sophisticated purpose evolution algorithms
- Adding cooperation or competition between entities
- Implementing entity networks with collaborative purpose fulfillment

## Running the Examples

To execute the example scenarios, run the following command:

```bash
npx ts-node entity-lifecycle-usage.ts
```

This will demonstrate the various aspects of the entity lifecycle system in action.
